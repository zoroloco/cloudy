# cloudy
A home cloud solution with a mobile app and server developed with Ionic and NodeJS.

I don't trust online cloud storage too much because I honestly do not know what is done with my data. I love to have my own copies of my images and videos on my own hard drives at home. I also do not like having to sync my phone and figure out what images I want to keep and what I want to discard.  I don't want to end up importing and backing up useless screenshots of boarding passes, etc.   

This project has two sections.  The mobile app and the server.

The server will be a node js app that listens for incoming data and stores it at your specified directory. This is something you have to setup at home preferrably with Linux. Well, atleast Linux for the first release.

Whenever you want to snap a picture on your mobile device that you want to keep, then you will use this mobile app and the picture will be synced to your home cloud. 

Lets see if I actually finish this project.
